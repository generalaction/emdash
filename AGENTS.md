**Quickstart**
1. `nvm use` (installs Node 22.20.0 if missing) or install Node 22.x manually.
2. `pnpm run d` to install dependencies, rebuild native modules, and launch Electron + Vite.
3. If `pnpm run d` fails mid-stream, rerun `pnpm install`, then `pnpm run dev` (main + renderer).

**Testing**
1. Run `pnpm run lint`.
2. Run `pnpm run type-check`.
3. Run `pnpm exec vitest run` (tests live under `src/**/*.test.ts`).

**Build & Package**
1. `pnpm run build` to compile the Electron main and Vite renderer.
2. Platform-specific installers: `pnpm run package:mac|linux|win` (artifacts in `release/`).
3. If native modules misbehave, `pnpm run rebuild`; use `pnpm run reset` as a last resort.

**Repo Map**
- `src/main/` – Electron main process, IPC, database access, CLI orchestration.
- `src/renderer/` – React UI, providers, terminal panes, integrations.
- `src/shared/` & `src/types/` – Shared utilities and type definitions.
- `drizzle/` – SQLite migrations generated by Drizzle ORM (`drizzle.config.ts` controls paths).
- `build/` – Electron Builder assets (entitlements, icons); avoid casual edits.

**Guardrails**
- Do work on branches or worktrees; default branch is `main`, never push directly.
- Do limit edits to `src/**`, `docs/**`, or config files you fully understand; keep binaries, `dist/`, and `release/` untouched.
- Do keep secrets local; configure providers via their CLIs, not committed files.
- Don't rewrite Drizzle migration history (`drizzle/meta`, numbered SQL) without coordinating.
- Don't modify telemetry defaults or updater logic unless the change is intentional and reviewed.
- Don't run commands that mutate global environments (package installs, git pushes) from agent scripts.

**Skills System**

Emdash implements the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard — a cross-agent specification for reusable skill packages. The standard defines skills as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter, adopted by Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Roo Code, Mistral Vibe, and others. Emdash builds on this standard to provide a unified management layer across all compatible agents.

*The Problem:* Every agent stores skills in its own directory — Claude Code uses `~/.claude/commands/`, Codex uses `~/.codex/skills/`, Cursor uses `~/.cursor/skills/`, etc. Two separate catalogs exist (OpenAI `openai/skills` repo, Anthropic `anthropics/skills` repo). Without a unified layer, you'd manually install the same skill into each agent's config directory.

*How it works:*
- **Agent Skills standard:** Every skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name, description) + markdown instructions, per the open spec. This is the format all compatible agents understand.
- **Central storage:** All skills live in `~/.agentskills/{skill-name}/`. Emdash metadata in `~/.agentskills/.emdash/`.
- **Agent sync via symlinks:** On install, Emdash symlinks from central storage into each detected agent's native directory (`~/.claude/commands/{skill}/`, `~/.codex/skills/{skill}/`, etc.). Each agent sees the skill in its own native format.
- **Aggregated catalog:** Emdash fetches skills from OpenAI's repo (with icons from `openai.yaml`), Anthropic's repo (descriptions from `SKILL.md` frontmatter), and local user-created skills — deduplicates by ID and merges into one browsable catalog.
- **One-click install/uninstall:** Downloads `SKILL.md` from GitHub, saves to `~/.agentskills/`, creates symlinks to all agents. Uninstall removes directory + symlinks.

*Key files:* `src/shared/skills/` (types, validation, agent targets), `src/main/services/SkillsService.ts` (core logic), `src/main/ipc/skillsIpc.ts` (IPC handlers), `src/renderer/components/skills/` (UI), `src/main/services/skills/bundled-catalog.json` (offline fallback).

*Usage:* Install a skill in the Emdash Skills view, then invoke it in the agent — e.g. `/skill-name` in Claude Code.

*Value:* Emdash is the first tool to implement the Agent Skills standard as a cross-agent management layer:
1. **One install, every agent.** Install a skill once from the Emdash catalog → it's immediately available in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, OpenCode, Roo Code, and Mistral Vibe via symlinks into each agent's native directory.
2. **Aggregated discovery.** Browse skills from both the OpenAI and Anthropic catalogs in one place, with icons, descriptions, and example prompts. No switching between GitHub repos.
3. **Full-machine awareness.** Emdash scans all 10+ known skill directories on your machine — if you installed a skill directly into Cursor or through another tool, Emdash discovers it and shows it in your inventory.
4. **Open standard, no lock-in.** Everything is based on the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open spec — a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter in a named directory. No proprietary format. Skills are portable plain text that any compatible agent can read.

**Risky Areas**
- `src/main/services/CodexService.ts` – manages long-lived child processes and log streaming; race conditions or unhandled exits can kill agent runs.
- `src/main/db/**` + `drizzle/` – schema migrations and SQLite access; mismatches can corrupt user data.
- `build/` entitlements and updater config – incorrect changes break signing/auto-update.
- Native dependencies (`sqlite3`, `node-pty`, `keytar`) – rebuilding is slow; avoid upgrading casually.

**Pre-PR Checklist**
- [ ] Dev server runs: `pnpm run d` (or `pnpm run dev`) starts cleanly.
- [ ] Tests and checks pass: `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run type-check`, `pnpm exec vitest run`.
- [ ] No stray build artifacts or secrets committed.
- [ ] Documented any schema or config changes impacting users.
