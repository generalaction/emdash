feat: add Cline CLI as a new AI coding agent provider

Add Cline CLI support to Emdash, enabling users to use Cline as an AI
coding agent provider alongside existing providers like Codex, Claude Code,
and others.

Changes:
- Add 'cline' to provider registry with installation command and docs URL
- Configure Cline provider metadata (CLI command, icon, terminal-only)
- Add Cline logo asset and provider configuration to all selector components
- Update type definitions to include Cline in multi-agent workspace types
- Use 'help' subcommand for version detection (Cline doesn't support --version)

Cline CLI runs AI coding agents directly in the terminal and supports
multiple model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.), making
it a flexible addition to the available provider options.
