# Workspace Server Daemon

The workspace server is a per-user Node process that exposes the
`workspaceWireContract` over either a Unix domain socket or stdio. The production
remote path is socket mode: the desktop connects over SSH stream-local forwarding
to the daemon's Unix socket, and the daemon serves each accepted socket as an
independent wire session.

Stdio mode runs the same controller over stdin/stdout. It is primarily a test and
debugging harness because stdout is reserved for the wire protocol.

## Process Roles

The command line has two roles:

- `serve` is the foreground server process. In socket mode, this is the daemon.
- `start`, `stop`, and `status` are short-lived lifecycle commands that manage or
  inspect the daemon process.

## Commands

Foreground serving:

```bash
emdash-workspace-server serve --socket
emdash-workspace-server serve --socket ~/.emdash/workspace-server/run/workspace.sock
emdash-workspace-server serve --stdio
```

Daemon lifecycle:

```bash
emdash-workspace-server start
emdash-workspace-server status
emdash-workspace-server stop
```

For backwards compatibility, invoking the binary with only flags still means
`serve`:

```bash
emdash-workspace-server --socket
emdash-workspace-server --stdio
```

Lifecycle commands use socket mode. Passing `--socket <path>` selects a custom
daemon instance; otherwise they use the default socket path.

## Runtime Files

All runtime files are derived from the socket path so custom socket paths remain
self-contained:

```text
~/.emdash/workspace-server/run/workspace.sock
~/.emdash/workspace-server/run/workspace.sock.pid
~/.emdash/workspace-server/run/workspace.sock.lock
~/.emdash/workspace-server/run/workspace.sock.log
~/.emdash/workspace-server/state/acp-attachments/
~/.emdash/workspace-server/state/acp-session-intents.json
~/.emdash/workspace-server/state/tui-agent-session-intents.json
~/.emdash/workspace-server/state/automations.db
~/.emdash/workspace-server/state/file-search.db
~/.emdash/workspace-server/state/host-dependencies.json
~/.emdash/workspace-server/state/worktrees/
```

- `.sock` is the Unix domain socket accepted by the foreground daemon.
- `.pid` records the daemon process id after socket serving starts.
- `.lock` prevents competing `start` calls from spawning duplicate daemons.
- `.log` receives stdout/stderr from the detached daemon process.
- `state/` stores runtime-owned databases, intents, attachments, dependency selections, and the
  worktree pool.

The socket directory is created with mode `0700`, so the filesystem boundary is
the local user account. Desktop clients reach the socket through SSH, not through
a TCP listener.

## Start Flow

`start` is intentionally conservative:

1. Derive socket, pid, lock, and log paths.
2. Acquire the exclusive lock file.
3. Probe the socket with the wire `health` procedure.
4. If the daemon is already healthy, return successfully without spawning.
5. Remove stale pid/socket files when no healthy daemon is present.
6. Spawn `serve --socket <path>` as a detached child with stdout/stderr redirected
   to the log file.
7. Wait until the socket answers `health`, then exit.

The lifecycle command does not keep the daemon alive after spawning it. Once the
detached `serve` process is healthy, it owns the socket and pid file until it
exits.

## Serve Flow

`serve --socket` owns the long-lived server lifecycle:

1. Create the runtime state directories and the in-process host-dependency store.
2. Start every required runtime and FS-watch subprocess and wait for readiness.
3. Build the aggregate controller from the required runtime clients.
4. Create the socket directory.
5. Probe any existing socket file before unlinking it. A live socket blocks
   startup; a dead socket file is removed.
6. Listen on the Unix socket and write the pid file.
7. For every accepted `net.Socket`, convert it to a `WireTransport` and open a
   session in `createWireSessionHub`.
8. On `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`, dispose all wire sessions, close the server, unlink
   the socket, remove the pid file, stop the runtime children, and exit.

The session hub is what lets one daemon serve multiple client connections while
keeping per-client live subscriptions, in-flight calls, and blob channels scoped
to the connection that created them.

## Runtime Workers

Both serve modes mount every core runtime as a child process. The parent creates workers through
`WireWorkerHost` using executable paths declared in the workspace-server worker manifest. Each
child entry initializes structured process logging and calls `runWireComponentWorker(...)`.

The worker dependency graph mirrors the desktop host:

- FS watch and terminals have no runtime-worker dependencies.
- ACP, agent config, and TUI agents consume the parent-owned host-dependency resolver.
- Files and file search consume FS watch; Git consumes FS watch and host dependencies.
- Workspace consumes terminals and FS watch.
- Automations starts last and consumes workspace, ACP sessions, and TUI sessions.

Every runtime is required. Failure to start any worker aborts server startup, while failures after
readiness use the worker host's supervision policy. Runtime logs are emitted as structured stderr
lines and forwarded by the parent process.

`startSession` and `resumeSession` return `{ sessionId }` through the ACP API. The
connected desktop client owns persistence for those returned ids when remote ACP
consumption is added.

## Stop Flow

`stop` uses the pid file rather than a wire shutdown RPC:

1. Read `<socketPath>.pid`.
2. If the pid file is missing or the process is already gone, remove the stale pid
   file and report `not-running`.
3. Send `SIGTERM` to the recorded pid.
4. Poll until the process is gone and the socket no longer answers `health`.
5. Remove the pid file.

There is no automatic `SIGKILL` escalation. A stuck process should be surfaced to
the caller rather than hidden.

## Status Flow

`status` connects to the Unix socket and calls `health`. A healthy response prints
the socket path, version, and uptime. A failed probe exits non-zero and reports
whether the daemon is not running or unhealthy.

## Code Map

- `src/index.ts` parses config, dispatches commands, and installs signal handlers
  for `serve`.
- `src/config.ts` defines command and serve-mode parsing.
- `src/daemon/paths.ts` centralizes socket, pid, lock, and log paths.
- `src/daemon/probe.ts` implements the wire `health` probe.
- `src/daemon/start.ts` implements locked detached startup and health waiting.
- `src/daemon/stop.ts` implements pid-file based `SIGTERM` shutdown.
- `src/daemon/status.ts` implements the status probe.
- `src/wire/serve-socket.ts` owns Unix socket serving and maps each accepted
  socket into a wire session.
- `src/wire/serve-stdio.ts` serves the same controller over stdin/stdout.
- `src/api/controller.ts` builds the `workspaceWireContract` controller.
- `src/gateway/workspace-workers.ts` owns the complete required worker graph and runtime state
  configuration.
- `src/gateway/worker-manifest.ts` selects the shared Core entries and app-local plugin entries for
  each packaged worker executable.
- `src/gateway/worker-paths.ts` resolves packaged worker executable paths at runtime.
- `src/gateway/entries/` contains the ACP, agent-config, and TUI-agent entries that inject the
  application plugin registry; all other workers reuse Core runtime entries directly.
- `src/runtime/paths.ts` owns runtime database, intent, attachment, and worktree-pool paths.

## Desktop Integration

Desktop-side daemon bootstrap is intentionally separate from this server package.
The intended flow is:

1. Resolve or establish the SSH connection.
2. Run `emdash-workspace-server start` on the remote host.
3. Open an SSH stream-local channel to the socket path.
4. Wrap that channel in `streamTransport(channel, channel)`.
5. Create a wire client and call `initialize`.

See `client-connection.md` for the target desktop-to-daemon connection model.

See `packaging.md` for self-contained release artifact targets, layout, build commands, and Linux
compatibility constraints.
