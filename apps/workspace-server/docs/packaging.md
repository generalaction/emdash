# Workspace Server Packaging

The workspace server is distributed as a self-contained archive for each supported operating
system and architecture. A remote machine does not need Node.js, npm, pnpm, or the Emdash
monorepo installed.

## Supported Targets

- `linux-x64`
- `linux-arm64`
- `darwin-arm64`

Darwin artifacts must be built on a matching Darwin host. Linux artifacts are built with Docker
Buildx, so either Linux architecture can be produced from a supported Docker host.

## Build an Artifact

Run the packaging command from `apps/workspace-server/` and provide one or more targets:

```bash
pnpm run package --target darwin-arm64
pnpm run package --target linux-x64 --target linux-arm64
```

Add `--verify` to smoke-test each finished archive:

```bash
pnpm run package --target darwin-arm64 --verify
pnpm run package --target linux-x64 --verify
```

Darwin verification extracts the archive into a temporary directory and runs the daemon's
`start`, `status`, and `stop` commands with an isolated socket. Linux verification runs the same
sequence in `debian:bookworm-slim`, where no host Node.js installation is available.

The packaging process:

1. Bundles the server and its ten workers with all pure-JavaScript dependencies emitted into the
   entry files or shared chunks.
2. Installs only `node-pty`, `better-sqlite3`, `@parcel/watcher`, and their runtime dependencies for
   the target platform. Linux native modules are compiled in the Docker builder; Darwin modules
   are installed with the downloaded target Node.js runtime.
3. Downloads the pinned ripgrep release for the target, verifies its repository-owned SHA-256,
   and copies `rg` plus its license files into the artifact.
4. Downloads the official Node version pinned by the repository's `.nvmrc`, verifies it against
   Node's published `SHASUMS256.txt`, and copies its `node` executable into the artifact.
5. Writes the launcher and manifest, then creates the archive under `dist-artifacts/`.
6. Writes a sibling `<archive>.sha256` file suitable for `sha256sum -c` verification.

Artifact URLs are immutable. Once an archive has been published for a workspace-server version,
that version must never be rebuilt with different contents. Any change that affects the packaged
artifact requires a version bump in `apps/workspace-server/package.json` before publication. The
desktop installer deliberately treats an existing `versions/<version>/` directory as final.

## Publish a Release

Workspace-server releases use the same Cloudflare R2 bucket and credentials as desktop releases.
All workspace-server objects live under the `workspace-server/` prefix:

```text
workspace-server/
  channels/
    stable/protocol-4.json
    canary/protocol-4.json
  <version>/
    install.sh
    emdash-workspace-server-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz
    emdash-workspace-server-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha256
    emdash-workspace-server-<version>-linux-arm64.tar.gz
    emdash-workspace-server-<version>-linux-arm64.tar.gz.sha256
    emdash-workspace-server-<version>-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
    emdash-workspace-server-<version>-darwin-arm64.tar.gz.sha256
```

The release workflow has `stable` and `canary` channels. Stable uses the version from
`apps/workspace-server/package.json`. Canary increments that version's patch and appends the
workflow run number: package version `0.1.0` becomes `0.1.1-canary.<run>`. Every run builds and
publishes its own immutable artifacts; releases are not promoted between channels.

Both channels build and smoke-verify all three targets, test `install.sh` against a local
`file://` mirror, and move only their own protocol-major pointer after every immutable object is
available. Existing versioned objects may only be skipped when their contents have the same
SHA-256; the uploader refuses to replace different contents. Channel pointers are the only mutable
release objects. Installation scripts exist only under immutable version directories, require
`--version`, and never select a release channel.

The workflow build matrix is derived from `releaseTargets` and its runner mapping in
`scripts/package-helpers.ts`. Adding or removing a release target there changes both the required
artifact set and the CI build matrix.

To publish stable:

1. Bump `version` in `apps/workspace-server/package.json`. Never reuse a published version.
2. Merge the change to `main`.
3. Dispatch `.github/workflows/release-workspace-server.yml` from GitHub Actions and select the
   `stable` channel, or run:

```bash
gh workflow run release-workspace-server.yml --ref main -f channel=stable
```

For a canary build, no package-version change is required: select `canary` or pass
`-f channel=canary`. Canary versions are derived from the package version and GitHub run number;
do not write the canary suffix into `package.json`.

For manual recovery, download the immutable versioned installer and pin that same version
explicitly:

```bash
version=<version>
curl -fsSL "https://releases.emdash.sh/workspace-server/$version/install.sh" |
  sh -s -- --version "$version"
```

The workflow fails before building if the version's Linux x64 archive already exists at
`https://releases.emdash.sh/workspace-server/`. Pull requests and pushes to `main` that affect the
workspace server or its bundled workspace packages also run
`.github/workflows/workspace-server-package-check.yml`, which packages and verifies Linux x64.
If the publish job fails after immutable artifacts are uploaded, use **Re-run failed jobs** on that
same GitHub Actions run. This reuses the retained build artifacts byte for byte; do not dispatch a
new run or choose **Re-run all jobs**. The upload is idempotent: equal immutable objects are skipped
and mutable selectors converge to the same release. Do not repair a partial publication by editing
R2 objects manually.

## Publish to Local Minio

The Docker remote dev loop uses the same object layout as R2, but publishes to the local minio
service from `docker-compose.yaml`:

```bash
pnpm run dev:remote
```

For manual iteration after minio is running, package one Linux target and publish the newest
matching artifact:

```bash
EMDASH_WS_DEV_VERSION=0.1.0-dev.manual pnpm run package --target linux-arm64
pnpm run upload:dev
```

`upload:dev` points the S3 uploader at `http://localhost:9000/emdash-releases` with the local minio
credentials. It defaults to the host's Linux target, picks the newest matching artifact under
`dist-artifacts/`, uploads `workspace-server/<version>/<artifact>` and its `.sha256` sidecar, then
advances the selected channel pointer. `pnpm run dev:remote` publishes both channel pointers for its
dev artifact. Pass `--version` and `--target` when you need an explicit override.

Downloaded Node archives are cached under `~/.cache/emdash/workspace-server/`. Set
`EMDASH_WS_PACKAGE_CACHE_DIR` to use another cache directory.

## Artifact Layout

```text
emdash-workspace-server/
  bin/emdash-workspace-server
  bin/rg
  node
  dist/
    index.mjs
    <ten worker>.mjs
    <shared chunks>.mjs
  licenses/
    ripgrep/
      COPYING
      LICENSE-MIT
      UNLICENSE
  node_modules/
    <native packages and runtime dependencies>
  manifest.json
```

The POSIX shell launcher resolves the artifact relative to its own path, exports the packaged app
version as `EMDASH_WS_APP_VERSION`, selects the bundled `bin/rg` through
`EMDASH_WS_RIPGREP_PATH`, and executes `dist/index.mjs` with the bundled Node runtime. The archive
may therefore be extracted to any directory. Source development runs do not set the ripgrep
override and continue to resolve `rg` from `PATH`.

`manifest.json` records the package name and version, workspace-server protocol version, target OS
and architecture, and bundled Node and ripgrep versions.

## Linux Compatibility

Linux artifacts use the official glibc-linked Node.js distribution and native modules built on
Debian Bookworm. The bundled ripgrep executable uses its upstream static musl target, but the
complete workspace-server artifact is still intended for glibc-based Linux hosts. Alpine and other
musl-based systems are not supported; a separate musl build pipeline would be required for those
hosts.

See `docker-remote.md` for the bare SSH container used to exercise installation and socket
forwarding with these artifacts.
