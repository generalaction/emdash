- **macOS**: [Download .dmg](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash/releases)
- **Windows**: [Download .exe](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash/releases)
- **Linux**: [Download .AppImage](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash/releases)

### From Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/generalaction/emdash.git
cd emdash
npm install
npm run build
npm run package
```

## Prerequisites

Before using Emdash, ensure you have:

1. **Git** installed and configured
2. **AI agent tools** installed (e.g., Claude Code, Codex)
3. **API keys** configured for your chosen agents

## First Steps

### 1. Open a Project

Launch Emdash and open a Git repository:

- Click **Open Repository** or use `Cmd/Ctrl + O`
- Select your project folder
- Emdash will verify it's a valid Git repository

### 2. Create a Workspace

A workspace represents a task with one or more agents:

- Click **New Workspace** or use `Cmd/Ctrl + N`
- Give your workspace a descriptive name
- Optionally add a description

### 3. Add Agents

Add AI agents to work on your task:

- Click **Add Agent** in your workspace
- Select agent type (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
- Configure agent settings
- Provide the task prompt

### 4. Start Working

- Click **Start** to launch all agents
- Monitor progress in real-time
- View file changes and terminal output
- Review and merge results when complete

## Next Steps

- Read the [User Guide](/user-guide) for detailed usage instructions
- Learn about [Architecture](/architecture) to understand how Emdash works
- Check out [Contributing](/contributing) to help improve Emdash

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Won't Start

- Verify the agent CLI tool is installed and in your PATH
- Check that API keys are configured correctly
- Review logs in the terminal panel

### Worktree Errors

- Ensure your repository is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Check that the `worktrees/` directory has proper permissions
- Try removing old worktrees: `git worktree prune`

### Performance Issues

- Close unused workspaces to free resources
- Limit the number of concurrent agents
- Check system resource usage (CPU, memory)
