# Welcome to Emdash

**Emdash** is a powerful desktop application that lets you run multiple AI coding agents (like Claude Code, Codex, and more) simultaneously on the same codebase. Each agent works in its own isolated Git worktree, allowing true parallel development without conflicts.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Run multiple AI agents at once, each tackling different tasks
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Every agent operates in its own Git worktree for clean separation
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Built on Electron**: Fast, native desktop experience
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch agents work with live terminal output and file changes

## Why Emdash?

Traditional AI coding assistants work sequentially, but many development tasks can be parallelized. Emdash lets you:

- **Work faster**: Multiple agents tackle different features simultaneously
- **Experiment safely**: Each agent in its own worktree means easy comparison and rollback
- **Scale your workflow**: Add more agents as your project grows
- **Stay organized**: Track all agent work from a single interface

## Open Source
