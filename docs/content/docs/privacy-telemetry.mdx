# Privacy & Telemetry

Emdash respects your privacy. This page explains our telemetry practices in detail.

## Overview

- Emdash collects **anonymous usage telemetry** to improve the app
- Telemetry is **enabled by default** but can be easily disabled
- Data is sent to PostHog using **explicit, allowlisted events only**
- **No autocapture or session recording** is enabled in the app

## How to Opt Out

### In-App Settings

1. Open Emdash Settings
2. Navigate to **General → Privacy & Telemetry**
3. Toggle telemetry **off**

### Environment Variable

Set the environment variable before launching the app:

```bash
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

This completely disables telemetry at the application level.

## What We Collect

We only collect **anonymous, aggregated usage data** to understand how Emdash is used and improve the product.

### Events Tracked

#### App Lifecycle Events

**`app_started`** (automatically on app launch)
- `app_version` - Emdash version number
- `electron_version` - Electron runtime version
- `platform` - Operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- `arch` - CPU architecture (x64, arm64)
- `is_dev` - Whether running in development mode
- `install_source` - Distribution channel (dmg, dev, etc.)

**`app_closed`** (automatically on app quit)
- Same properties as `app_started`

**`app_session`** (on quit; duration only)
- `session_duration_ms` - How long the app was open

#### Usage Events

**`workspace_snapshot`** (early in app lifecycle)
- `project_count` - Total number of projects
- `project_count_bucket` - Coarse bucket (e.g., "1-5", "6-10")
- `workspace_count` - Total number of workspaces
- `workspace_count_bucket` - Coarse bucket

**`feature_used`**
- `feature` - Name of the feature (string)

**`error`**
- `type` - Error category (string, no stack traces or details)

#### Agent Events

**`agent_run_start`**
- `provider` - CLI provider ID (e.g., "claude-code", "codex")

**`agent_run_finish`**
- `provider` - CLI provider ID
- `outcome` - Result: `ok` or `error` (no details)
- `duration_ms` - How long the agent ran (clamped, no content)

## What We DON'T Collect

We take privacy seriously. The following data is **never** collected:

- ❌ **No code or file contents**
- ❌ **No file paths or repository names**
- ❌ **No prompts or messages sent to agents**
- ❌ **No environment variables**
- ❌ **No personally identifiable information (PII)**
- ❌ **No user text input or command contents**
- ❌ **No IP-derived location data**
- ❌ **No session recordings or screen captures**
- ❌ **No autocapture of user interactions**

### Agent Usage Privacy

When tracking agent usage, we only collect:
- Provider name (e.g., "claude-code")
- Start/finish timestamps
- Success or failure outcome
- Duration

We **do not** collect:
- Prompts or messages
- Code changes
- File paths
- Workspace names or IDs
- Any content from terminal streams

## How It Works

### Anonymous Identification

- A random **anonymous `instanceId`** is generated on first launch
- Stored locally in `${appData}/telemetry.json`
- Used as `distinct_id` for telemetry events
- Not linked to any personal information

### Data Sanitization

All telemetry data passes through a **sanitizer** that:
- Only allows explicitly allowlisted properties
- Drops any unexpected or sensitive data
- Enforces data types and formats
- Prevents accidental leakage

### Local Development

- Official builds include PostHog credentials via CI
- Local development builds **do not send telemetry** unless credentials are explicitly added for testing
- Development mode is clearly marked in events

## For Developers

### Environment Variables

**For Users:**
- `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` (default: `true`) - Set to `false` to disable

**For Maintainers:**
- `INSTALL_SOURCE` - Labels distribution channel (e.g., `dmg`, `dev`)
- PostHog credentials are injected via CI for official builds

### Renderer Process Events

The renderer may request sending `feature_used` or `error` events via IPC:
- Constrained IPC channel handled in main process
- Only allowlisted properties are forwarded
- Everything else is dropped by the sanitizer

### Adding New Events

If you're contributing and want to add telemetry events:
1. Only track coarse, anonymous metrics
2. Add event to allowlist in telemetry service
3. Document in this file
4. Ensure no PII or sensitive data is included

## Transparency

We believe in transparency about data collection:

- This documentation is version-controlled and public
- Telemetry code is open source in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash)
- Event definitions are hardcoded (no dynamic tracking)
- You can audit exactly what is collected

## Questions?

If you have questions or concerns about privacy:

- **Read the code**: Check `src/main/services/telemetryService.ts`
- **Open an issue**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash/issues)
- **Start a discussion**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash/discussions)

We're happy to answer any privacy-related questions!
