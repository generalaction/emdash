description: Run coding agents on remote machines over SSH
---

Run coding agents on a remote server over SSH. Instead of working only with local repositories, you can connect to any machine and orchestrate agents against codebases hosted there.

## Adding a Remote Project

1. On the home screen, click **Add Remote Project**
2. A wizard walks you through four steps:

### Step 1: Connection Details

Enter the SSH connection info:

- **Name** — a label for this connection (e.g., "Dev Server")
- **Host** — hostname or IP address
- **Port** — SSH port (default: 22)
- **Username** — your SSH user

If you have an existing `~/.ssh/config`, Emdash detects it automatically. Select a host from the dropdown to pre-fill the form.

    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: '700px',
    margin: '20px auto',
    display: 'block',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
  }}
/>

### Step 2: Authentication

Choose an authentication method:

| Method          | Description                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SSH Agent**   | Uses your system SSH agent. No keys stored in Emdash. Recommended.                               |
| **Private Key** | Point to a key file (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`). Passphrase stored securely in your OS keychain. |
| **Password**    | Direct password auth. Password stored in your OS keychain.                                       |

Click **Test Connection** to verify before proceeding.

If SSH agent auth fails, Emdash suggests falling back to key-based auth and shows common key paths.

    maxWidth: '700px',
    margin: '20px auto',
    display: 'block',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
  }}
/>

### Step 3: Path Selection

Browse the remote filesystem via SFTP and select your project directory. The browser starts at your home directory.

  style={{
    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: '700px',
    margin: '20px auto',
    display: 'block',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
  }}
/>

### Step 4: Confirmation

Review the connection summary and click **Save**. The project appears in your sidebar.

## Connection Status

Remote projects show a connection indicator in the sidebar:

- **Connected** — ready to use
- **Connecting** — establishing SSH session
- **Error** — connection failed (click to retry)
- **Disconnected** — no active session

Emdash auto-connects when you select a remote project and monitors the connection with periodic health checks. If the connection drops, it reconnects automatically with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts).

## How It Works

When you create a task on a remote project:

1. A git worktree is created on the remote machine
2. The agent runs in a shell session over SSH
3. File browsing and git operations happen remotely via SFTP
4. Terminal output streams back to your local Emdash UI in real time

All shell commands are executed on the remote server. Your local machine only runs the Emdash interface.

## Security

- **Credentials** are stored in your OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager) — never in the database
- **Host keys** are verified against `~/.ssh/known_hosts` to prevent MITM attacks
- **Shell commands** are escaped using POSIX single-quote wrapping to prevent injection
- **Path traversal** is blocked — sensitive directories like `/etc`, `/proc`, `/sys`, and `.ssh` are restricted

## Requirements

- SSH access to the remote machine
- Git installed on the remote server
- At least one [provider](/providers) CLI installed on the remote machine

## Supported Git Features

Remote projects support the same git workflow as local projects:

- File status watching with automatic change detection
- File diffs with side-by-side viewer
- Stage, unstage, and revert individual files or all files
- Commit and push from the UI
- Branch status (ahead/behind counts)
- Branch listing and branch rename
- PR creation (regular and draft), merge, and status checks
- PR comments and CI check runs

## Remote Server Prerequisites

Your remote server needs the following for full functionality:

1. **Git** installed and configured with `user.name` and `user.email`
2. **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** installed and authenticated (required for PR features)
3. **SSH key for GitHub** configured on the server (required for push/pull)

See the [SSH Setup Guide](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash/blob/main/docs/ssh-setup.md) for detailed server preparation steps.

## Current Limitations

Some features are not yet available for remote projects:

- Worktree pooling (instant task start)
- Worktree merge via UI
- Session isolation for multi-chat (--session-id)
- Plan lock/unlock
- Remote lifecycle scripts
