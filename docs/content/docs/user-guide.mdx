# User Guide

Master Emdash with this comprehensive guide to features and workflows.

## Understanding Workspaces

Workspaces are the core organizing unit in Emdash. Each workspace:

- Represents a single task or feature
- Can contain multiple agents working in parallel
- Has its own Git worktree for isolation
- Tracks agent progress and file changes

### Creating Workspaces

1. Click **New Workspace** or press `Cmd/Ctrl + N`
2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Add dark mode")
3. Optionally add a description
4. Click **Create**

### Managing Workspaces

- **Rename**: Click the workspace name to edit
- **Delete**: Right-click and select "Delete Workspace"
- **Archive**: Move completed workspaces to archive
- **Switch**: Click any workspace to view its agents

## Working with Agents

### Agent Types

Emdash supports multiple agent types:

- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's coding agent with advanced reasoning
- **Codex**: OpenAI's code generation agent
- **Custom**: Add your own agent integrations

### Adding Agents

1. Open a workspace
2. Click **Add Agent**
3. Select agent type
4. Configure settings:
   - Model selection
   - Context window
   - Temperature
5. Provide task prompt
6. Click **Add**

### Agent Prompts

Write effective prompts for better results:

**Good prompts:**
- Clear and specific: "Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page"
- Include context: "Use Tailwind CSS for styling"
- Specify constraints: "Don't modify the authentication logic"

**Avoid:**
- Vague requests: "Make it better"
- Multiple unrelated tasks in one prompt
- Contradictory instructions

### Monitoring Agents

Track agent progress in real-time:

- **Status**: See if agents are running, idle, or completed
- **Terminal**: View agent output and commands
- **File Changes**: See what files are being modified
- **Diff Viewer**: Review code changes with syntax highlighting

## Git Worktrees

### What are Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow multiple working directories for the same repository. Emdash uses worktrees to:

- Isolate each agent's changes
- Prevent merge conflicts between agents
- Allow easy comparison of different approaches
- Enable safe experimentation

### Worktree Organization

Emdash creates worktrees in a sibling `worktrees/` directory:

```
your-project/
├── .git/
├── src/
└── ...

worktrees/
├── workspace-1-agent-1/
├── workspace-1-agent-2/
└── workspace-2-agent-1/
```

### Cleaning Up Worktrees

Emdash automatically removes worktrees when:
- You delete a workspace
- An agent completes and you merge changes
- The application detects orphaned worktrees

Manual cleanup (if needed):
```bash
git worktree prune
```

## Reviewing Changes

### Diff Viewer

Review code changes before merging:

1. Click on a modified file
2. View side-by-side or unified diff
3. Syntax highlighting for all languages
4. Navigate between changes easily

### Merging Changes

When agents complete their work:

1. Review all file changes
2. Test the changes if needed
3. Click **Merge to Main**
4. Resolve any conflicts
5. Worktree is automatically cleaned up

### Handling Conflicts

If multiple agents modify the same code:

1. Emdash detects conflicts
2. Manual resolution required
3. Use Git merge tools or editor
4. Complete merge after resolution

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Global

- `Cmd/Ctrl + N`: New workspace
- `Cmd/Ctrl + O`: Open repository
- `Cmd/Ctrl + ,`: Open settings
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Q`: Quit application

### Workspace

- `Cmd/Ctrl + T`: New agent
- `Cmd/Ctrl + W`: Close workspace
- `Cmd/Ctrl + R`: Restart agent
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: Stop agent

### Navigation

- `Cmd/Ctrl + 1-9`: Switch between workspaces
- `Tab`: Cycle through agents
- `Cmd/Ctrl + [`: Previous workspace
- `Cmd/Ctrl + ]`: Next workspace

## Best Practices

### Workspace Organization

- One task per workspace
- Clear, descriptive names
- Archive completed workspaces
- Delete failed experiments

### Agent Prompts

- Be specific and clear
- Provide context from the codebase
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Test one approach per agent

### Performance

- Close unused workspaces
- Limit concurrent agents (3-4 recommended)
- Monitor system resources
- Clear logs periodically

### Git Hygiene

- Start with a clean working directory
- Commit or stash changes before using Emdash
- Regularly prune old worktrees
- Keep your main branch up to date

## Tips & Tricks

### Parallel Experimentation

Try different approaches simultaneously:
1. Create one workspace
2. Add multiple agents
3. Give each agent a different approach
4. Compare results and choose the best

### Incremental Development

Break large features into steps:
1. Create workspaces for each step
2. Complete and merge sequentially
3. Each agent builds on previous work
4. Maintain clean Git history

### Learning from Agents

Agents can teach you:
- New patterns and techniques
- Better code organization
- Testing strategies
- Documentation styles

### Backup and Recovery

- Emdash tracks all changes in Git
- Each worktree is a full Git repository
- You can always recover previous states
- Use Git tags for important milestones
