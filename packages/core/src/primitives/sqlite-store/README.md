# SQLite stores

`sqlite-store` standardizes how Emdash opens, migrates, tests, backs up, and
rebuilds SQLite files. It deliberately does not depend on an ORM or a particular
SQLite package. A host supplies a `SqliteDriver` and may attach an ORM through
`createOrm`.

## Choose a store type

| Concern | Durable store | Derived store |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intended data | User-authored or otherwise irreplaceable | Cache or index reproducible from another source |
| Schema changes | Ordered migration history | Drop and rebuild |
| Version state | `__emdash_migrations` plus runner metadata | Schema fingerprint in `PRAGMA user_version` |
| Backups | Optional, before pending migrations | Not supported |
| Downgrade behavior | Unknown newer migration rows are tolerated | Any version mismatch rebuilds |
| Migration tests | `openAtMigration()` | Rebuild/idempotence tests |

Use `defineDurableSqliteStore()` unless losing the whole database is always safe.
A derived store's `createSchema` must be capable of recreating everything from
scratch at any time.

## Defining stores

### Durable

The application owns the driver adapter and ORM attachment:

```ts
import { defineDurableSqliteStore } from '@emdash/core/primitives/sqlite-store/node';
import { assertSqliteStoreInvariants } from '@emdash/core/primitives/sqlite-store/testing';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3';
import { betterSqlite3Driver } from './better-sqlite3-driver';
import { migrations } from './migrations.generated';
import * as schema from './schema';

export const appStore = defineDurableSqliteStore({
  name: 'app',
  driver: betterSqlite3Driver,
  migrations,
  createOrm: (connection) => drizzle(connection.native, { schema }),
  backup: { retain: 2 },
  invariants: [assertSqliteStoreInvariants],
});

const handle = appStore.open('/path/to/emdash.db');
handle.db.select().from(schema.projects);
handle.close();
```

`createOrm` is optional. Without it, `handle.db` is the `SqliteConnection`.
`postMigrate` hooks run with foreign keys enabled whenever the latest schema is
opened. `invariants` run after those hooks when migrations were applied, for
every `openTemp()`, and after every `migrateToLatest()`. No-op production opens
skip invariants so full database scans do not become a startup cost.

### Derived

```ts
import {
  defineDerivedSqliteStore,
  fingerprintDerivedSchema,
  nodeSqliteDriver,
} from '@emdash/core/primitives/sqlite-store/node';

const schemaSql = `
  CREATE TABLE indexed_paths (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    path TEXT NOT NULL
  ) STRICT
`;

export const searchStore = defineDerivedSqliteStore({
  name: 'file-search',
  driver: nodeSqliteDriver,
  version: fingerprintDerivedSchema(schemaSql),
  createSchema(connection) {
    connection.exec(schemaSql);
  },
});
```

When `user_version` is lower or higher than `version`, the primitive removes all
non-internal schema objects, calls `createSchema`, and stamps the requested
version in one transaction. Rebuilding a higher version is intentional: derived
stores remain usable after an application downgrade.

`fingerprintDerivedSchema()` converts the schema SQL itself into a positive
31-bit `user_version`. It normalizes formatting whitespace outside quoted SQL
values before computing SHA-256, so reformatting or changing line endings does
not rebuild production stores. Meaningful DDL and quoted-value changes do. Pass
the exact SQL constant executed by `createSchema`; when schema codegen is added,
compute the fingerprint from generator input before formatting generated
TypeScript.

## Driver contract

`SqliteConnection` exposes only:

- `exec(sql)` for DDL and multi-statement SQL;
- `get`, `all`, and `run` for prepared statements;
- `close`;
- `native` as an escape hatch for ORM attachment.

The store—not the driver—owns pragmas and transaction behavior. Every open sets
WAL mode, `busy_timeout`, and foreign-key enforcement. Transactions use explicit
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`, so different drivers cannot
silently change migration semantics. Transaction callbacks must be synchronous.

Use `runSqliteDriverConformance()` from the testing entry point when adding a
driver. It verifies multi-statement execution, parameter binding, result shape,
TEXT/INTEGER/BLOB/NULL round trips, exact large integers, runner pragmas,
foreign-key toggling, transaction semantics, and `VACUUM INTO`.

## Durable migrations

A bundled migration contains stable identity and raw SQL:

```ts
type BundledMigration = {
  idx: number;
  tag: string;
  when: number; // legacy Drizzle journal milliseconds
  hash: string; // SHA-256 of raw SQL file bytes
  sql: string;
};
```

The runner:

1. Bootstraps its bookkeeping schema when `user_version` is zero.
2. Reads applied tags and verifies hashes for migrations known to this binary.
3. Computes pending work by tag set difference, ordered by `idx`.
4. Creates a backup when configured and a persistent database needs work.
5. Disables foreign keys **before** opening migration transactions.
6. Applies each migration atomically, splitting Drizzle SQL on
   `--> statement-breakpoint`.
7. Records `(tag, hash, applied_at)` in `__emdash_migrations`.
8. Runs optional interop inside the same transaction.
9. Runs `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`, then reenables enforcement in `finally`.

Rows for migrations unknown to an older binary are ignored. This allows additive
database upgrades to remain downgrade-tolerant. A known tag with a different
hash throws because shipped migration SQL is immutable.

Durable migration hashes are SHA-256 of the raw SQL file bytes. The algorithm
is part of the runner schema contract rather than a per-row `hash_algo` column:
changing it requires a `RUNNER_SCHEMA_VERSION` bump that explicitly rewrites
bookkeeping. Derived fingerprints need no stored algorithm because a changed
implementation causes one safe rebuild and then becomes self-consistent.

SQLite ignores `PRAGMA foreign_keys` changes inside a transaction. Migration SQL
may contain those pragmas, but correctness comes from the outer runner protocol.

### Legacy migration interop

Migration history conversion is optional and pluggable:

```ts
type MigrationInterop = {
  backfill?(connection, migrations): void;
  onApplied?(connection, migration): void;
};
```

`backfill` runs once inside the bookkeeping bootstrap transaction. `onApplied`
runs inside each migration transaction after the new bookkeeping row is
inserted.

`drizzleV0Interop` supports databases written by Drizzle's v0 journal layout. It:

- reads `__drizzle_migrations`;
- matches rows by `created_at === migration.when`, falling back to SQL hash;
- throws rather than guessing if a row cannot be identified;
- dual-writes newly applied migrations to `__drizzle_migrations`.

Dual-write keeps older application binaries from reapplying migrations after a
downgrade. Configure this interop only for stores with that legacy history.

## Backups and restore

Durable stores with `backup: { retain: N }` create consistent sibling backups
using `VACUUM INTO` before pending migrations. Paths are SQL-escaped, and old
backups are pruned by the creation timestamp embedded in their filename.

Call `restoreLatestBackup(path)` only when every handle for that store path is
closed. Restore removes stale WAL/SHM sidecars and replaces the database through
a temporary file. The method refuses to run while the path is open.
That open-path guard is scoped to one store instance; callers must share the
defined store rather than independently defining stores for the same file.

## Testing

### Fully migrated temporary database

`openTemp` creates an isolated on-disk database, applies all migrations, awaits
the optional seed, and deletes the database plus WAL/SHM files on close:

```ts
const handle = await appStore.openTemp(async ({ db }) => {
  await db.insert(projects).values({ id: 'project-1', name: 'Example' });
});

try {
  // test against handle.db or handle.connection
} finally {
  handle.close();
}
```

It is intentionally file-backed rather than `:memory:` so WAL, backup, and
multi-connection behavior stay representative.

### Testing a specific migration

`openAtMigration(n)` applies migrations whose `idx < n`. Seed pre-migration data
with raw SQL, because latest-schema ORM types cannot faithfully describe an old
schema:

```ts
const handle = appStore.openAtMigration(18);
try {
  handle.connection.exec(`
    INSERT INTO workspaces (id, type, ssh_connection_id)
    VALUES ('workspace-1', 'project-ssh', 'missing-ssh')
  `);

  handle.migrateToLatest();
  assertSqliteStoreInvariants(handle.connection);
} finally {
  handle.close();
}
```

This replaces opaque binary pre-migration fixtures with reviewable, adversarial
test setup. `openAtMigration` and backup/restore exist only on the durable store
type.

`assertIncrementalMigrationEquivalence(store, migrationCount)` opens every
historical migration boundary, migrates it to latest, and compares its
`sqlite_schema` with a one-shot latest database. Use it as a compact regression
test for the complete migration chain.

## Invariants

- Never edit SQL for a shipped migration. Hash verification will reject it.
- Hash raw UTF-8 file bytes without trimming or line-ending normalization.
- Preserve legacy `when` milliseconds while `drizzleV0Interop` is needed.
- `PRAGMA user_version` belongs exclusively to the store primitive: durable
  stores use it for runner metadata; derived stores use it for a schema
  fingerprint.
- Domain code must not read or write `user_version`.
- Derived data must be safe to delete at any time.
- Store initialization after migration throws on integrity failures.
  `assertSqliteIntegrity` runs SQLite's full B-tree and index consistency check;
  `assertForeignKeyIntegrity` scans for orphaned references. This intentionally
  differs from expected operational failures that use `Result`: callers cannot
  safely continue with an unidentified or corrupt schema.
