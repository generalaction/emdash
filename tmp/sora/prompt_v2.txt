Subject: laptop screen running a coding workflow UI with split panes
Action: cursor selects an issue, terminal command runs, then a green check appears in the status rail
Camera: slow left-to-right slider move, medium close-up, subtle parallax from foreground keyboard
Lighting/mood: cooler moonlit key with subtle cyan edge light, crisp and technical mood
