/**
 * Builds the workspace packages before a flow that bypasses Nx task
 * orchestration — app-only dev (`pnpm run dev` from apps/emdash-desktop) and
 * Storybook run their underlying tool directly, so on a never-built clone the
 * workspace `dist/` outputs their imports resolve to would not exist yet.
 *
 * When the calling script is itself executed as an Nx task (root `pnpm run
 * dev`, `nx storybook @emdash/ui`, ...), Nx's `^build` dependency wiring has
 * already ordered the builds, so this exits immediately. Warm re-runs are Nx
 * cache hits and cost around a second.
